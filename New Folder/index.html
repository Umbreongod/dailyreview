                <h3>May 16, 2000</h3>
                <h3>Fresno, CA</h3>
                    <p>My name is Yvette Robles and I was born in May 16, 2000 and was born in my home town Fresno, CA.
                    My family is hard working, but my parents were separated when I was 1-years-old. My mom is very nice
                    and hardworking into keeping us happy and healthy.I have three siblings, two sisters and one brother. 
                    They are very annoying, but I still love them</p>
                    <p>I have two main hobbies, one is video games and the other is drawing. 
                    I love those two hobbies, they pass my time and entertain me at the same time. My dream vacation someday is to go to Tokyo or Hawaii, 
                    they will both suffice. Tokyo is in Japan and home of anime. Hawaii, is a place of relaxation and adventure.
                    A place I would like to visit is San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge is there and Ubisoft a famous game development company. 
                    </p>

                <h3>Long term goals</h3>
                    <p>	In the future, my long-term goals, I plan to go to a good college that focuses on Graphic Designing and coding.
                    I do want to work for a game company a type of company that creates websites and such. Maybe someday even own a company. 
                    I also plan on having a good home, one which my family can stay and live a good and relaxing life. I would love to repay
                    for what they gave to me.</p>
                        <p>For now, in this present time, my short term goals are the ones I can achieve from a
                    time range of one week to a year. I plan to work hard and get a very high GPA that will allow me to get scholarships
                    when I graduate. I also want to practice drawing so when I become a Graphic designer I will be one of the greatest.
                    I also want to be out there, help a lot so it can look good and people will want to hire me or want to have me in
                    contact so I can be known throughout the state. </p>
